 |                       Lab 10: Eulerian Cycles (20 PTS)                        |
 |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|#


#| In this lab, we'll implement a test to determine whether
 |   an undirected graph contains an Eulerian cycle.
 | We'll use the following terminology for datatypes in the lab:
 | - A "natural" is an integer â‰¥ 0.
 | - A "vertex" is a natural.
 | - An "edge" is a list of two vertices.
 |   All edges in this lab are undirected.
 |   In other words, (1 2) and (2 1) are considered equivalent.
 | - A "graph" is a list of edges.
 |   All graphs in this lab are undirected.
 |   Empty graphs ARE always valid input for any function in the lab.
 |   You MAY assume that a graph does not contain duplicates edges,
 |     including symmetric edges.
 |   In other words, if (1 2) is listed as an edge of a graph,
 |     the list of edges will not contain another instance of (1 2),
 |     NOR will it contain any instances of (2 1).
 |
 | As a refresher, an Eulerian cycle is a cycle which traverses
 |   every edge of a graph exactly once.
 | Given an arbitrary undirected graph G,
 |   G contains an Eulerian cycle iff it satisfies two conditions:
 |   1. The degree of every vertex in G is even.
 |   2. G is connected, save any vertices of degree 0.

 |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|#

;; Provided in this section are some helper functions.
;; You MAY and should use these anywhere you want in your implementations.


#| "remove" accepts lists L and R
 |   and returns L filtered such that all elements of L
 |   which are also in R have been removed.
 |#
;; Type signature: (remove list list) -> list
(define (remove L R)
  (define (recurse acc L)
    (if (null? L) (reverse acc)
        (recurse (if (member (car L) R)
                     acc
                     (cons (car L) acc))
                 (cdr L))))
  (recurse '() L))




#| "usort" accepts a list of naturals L
 |   and returns L sorted from least to greatest
 |   with all duplicate elements removed (hence "unique-sort").
 |#
;; Type signature: (usort list-of-naturals) -> list-of-naturals
(define (usort L)	
  (define (recurse acc L)	
    (if (null? L) acc
        (let ([m (apply max L)])	
          (recurse (cons m acc) (remove L (list m))))))	
  (recurse '() L))




#| "dfs" accepts a graph G and vertex v
 |   and returns a list of all vertices accessible from v
 |   via some sequence of edges in G.
 | The returned list of vertices may be unsorted and may contain duplicates.
 | This function requires a working implementation of the function "adjacent",
 |   which you'll implement later.
 |#
;; Type signature: (dfs graph vertex) -> list-of-vertices
(define (dfs G v)
  (define (helper found v)
    (define next-found (cons v found))
    (define adj (remove (adjacent G v) next-found))
    (define (f x) (helper next-found x))
    (define res (apply append (map f adj)))
    (cons v res))
  (helper '() v))




#|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 |                        Part 1: Condition #1                   |
 |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|#


#|
 | Paste your functions from Part 1 here!!!
 |#




#|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 |                         Part 2: Condition #2 (4 EC PTS)                          |
 |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|#


#| Now we'll implement a test for whether a graph satisfies
 |   the second condition necessary for an Eulerian cycle to exist:
 |   is the graph connected?
 |
 | An undirected graph is connected if a path (a sequence of edges) exists
 |   from every vertex to every other vertex.
 | Again, the exception we're making to this rule is to ignore
 |   "isolated" vertices of degree 0, since they do not effect
 |   the existence of an Eulerian cycle.
 |#


#| 
 | Paste your solution for adjacent here!
 |#

;; Type signature: (adjacent graph vertex) -> list-of-vertices
;; 4 PTS
(define (adjacent G v)
  "TODO: Implement")




#| Implement "connected?" to accept a graph G
 |   and return whether G is connected.
 | Take advantage of the "dfs" helper function,
 |   as it will return all of the vertices reachable
 |   from some starting vertex.
 | Given that G is undirected, if it is connected
 |   you should be able to start from any initial vertex
 |   and reach every other vertex.
 | So, find a way to select any arbitrary vertex
 |   from G, and invoke "dfs" with that vertex as the initial vertex.
 | If the graph is connected, the output of the depth-first search
 |   will contain all the vertices in the graph.
 | Consider, given the provided functions,
 |   how you can easily compare the contents of the "dfs" output
 |   with G's list of vertices.
 |
 | Examples:
 |   (connected? C6)       -> #t
 |   (connected? K4)       -> #t
 |   (connected? full5)    -> #t
 |   (connected? btree)    -> #t
 |   (connected? triforce) -> #t
 |   (connected? polygons) -> #f
 |   (connected? reflex)   -> #f
 |   (connected? empty)    -> #t
 |#

;; Type signature: (connected? graph) -> boolean
;; 4 PTS
(define (connected? G)
  "TODO: Implement")

#| Implement "eulerian?", which accepts a graph G
 |   and returns whether G contains an Eulerian cycle
 |   (a.k.a. G is an "Eulerian graph").
 | Use the two conditions we've now implemented
 |   and check that G satisfies both.
 |
 | Examples:
 |   (eulerian? C6)       -> #t
 |   (eulerian? K4)       -> #f
 |   (eulerian? full5)    -> #t
 |   (eulerian? btree)    -> #f
 |   (eulerian? triforce) -> #t
 |   (eulerian? polygons) -> #f
 |   (eulerian? reflex)   -> #f
 |   (eulerian? empty)    -> #t
